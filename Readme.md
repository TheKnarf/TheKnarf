# Sometimes I write code

I have organized my code under a few different orgs:

- [TheKnarf](https://github.com/theknarf) - my main stuff

- [Experiments](https://github.com/theknarf-experiments) - Unfinnished and experimental stuff

- [Talks](https://github.com/theknarf-talks) - Code and slides from talks, workshops and lectures

- [School](https://github.com/theknarf-school) - Old school projects

I also sometimes stream at Twitch as [YakPie](http://yakpie.com/), the code often ends up on the github org [YakPie](https://github.com/YakPie).
